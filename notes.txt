Amazon sage maker : Amazon SageMaker is a fully managed machine learning service. With SageMaker, 
data scientists and developers can quickly and easily build and train machine learning models, 
and then directly deploy them into a production-ready hosted environment. 

benifits : 
  reduces machine learning data costs
  AI/ML components are stored in one place
  Highly scalable
  Trains model faster
  Maintains uptime
  High data sequrity 
  easy data trasfers
  
  
 * CUstomize ML models with jupyter note books
 * it devides the training data and stores in Amazon S3, where as the training algorithm stored 
 in ECR
 * Later sagemaker sets up a cluster for the input data, trains it and stores it in Amazon s2 itself.
 * Once tuning is done models can be deplyed into sage maker endpoints
 * In the endpoints, real-time prediction is performed.
